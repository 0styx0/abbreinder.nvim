" abbriender.start's nvim_buf_attach on_bytes does not trigger except on the
" last character passed in to nvim_feedkeys. this means that
" abbreinder._keylogger is not properly updated and tests do not work as they
" should. adding an InsertCharPre autocmd that appears to do nothing fixes the
" issue and successfully triggers on_bytes as intended (possibly by
" jumstarting the event queue on each insertion, idk). took me a while to solve.
" although since I still couldn't get it working, I'm pretty sure this is a
" piece of the solution but I'm giving up.
